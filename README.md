# Active-Band-Pass-Filter-using-Transistors
I have accomplished this project for Electroinc Circuit 2 course.
This project is an application of an Active Band Pass Filter using NPN BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor).
The report has a complete description of the project with its circuit implementation, mathematical equations, and analysis.
